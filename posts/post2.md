# Effective Cross-Team Coordination

One of the most challenging aspects of a TPM's role is coordinating work across multiple teams that often have different priorities, processes, and communication styles. This article provides strategies for successful cross-team coordination.

## The Challenges of Cross-Team Work

Cross-team coordination introduces several challenges:

- **Misaligned priorities**: Different teams have different OKRs and roadmaps
- **Communication barriers**: Teams may have different communication norms and tools
- **Dependency management**: Work sequencing becomes more complex with multiple teams
- **Competing resources**: Teams may be fighting for the same limited resources
- **Cultural differences**: Engineering, product, design, and other teams have different cultures

## Key Strategies for Success

### 1. Establish a Clear Governance Model

Define and document how decisions will be made:

- Who has decision-making authority for different aspects of the program
- How conflicts will be resolved
- What escalation paths look like
- Which forums exist for cross-team alignment

### 2. Create Shared Understanding

Ensure all teams understand:

- The overall goals and success metrics of the program
- How their work contributes to those goals
- The end-to-end user journey or system architecture
- Key dependencies between teams
- Major milestones and deadlines

Visual aids like journey maps, architecture diagrams, and dependency graphs are invaluable here.

### 3. Implement Effective Communication Patterns

Establish regular touchpoints:

- **Daily**: Quick async updates for blockers and critical issues
- **Weekly**: Cross-team sync meetings focused on dependencies and integration points
- **Bi-weekly/Monthly**: Program reviews with broader stakeholders
- **Ad-hoc**: Issue-specific working sessions as needed

### 4. Build a Dependency Management System

Create a system that:

- Clearly identifies dependencies between teams
- Specifies what each team needs to deliver and by when
- Tracks the status of each dependency
- Highlights at-risk dependencies that need attention

### 5. Foster Relationships Across Teams

Technical solutions aren't enoughâ€”relationships matter:

- Schedule regular 1:1s with key members of each team
- Create opportunities for teams to socialize and build rapport
- Recognize and celebrate cross-team collaboration successes
- Address interpersonal conflicts quickly and directly

## Running Effective Cross-Team Meetings

Cross-team meetings are your primary forum for alignment. Make them count:

1. **Have a clear agenda** focused on cross-team issues
2. **Pre-distribute materials** so people come prepared
3. **Focus on decisions and actions**, not status updates
4. **Document outcomes** and follow up on action items
5. **Invite only those who need to be there**

Remember that your role as a TPM is to remove friction in cross-team collaboration, not add process for its own sake. Always ask whether a meeting, document, or process truly helps teams work together more effectively.
