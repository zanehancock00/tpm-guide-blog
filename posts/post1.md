# Getting Started as a TPM

As a new Technical Program Manager (TPM), you're stepping into a critical role that bridges the gap between technical implementation and business objectives. This guide will help you navigate your first few months and set you up for success.

## What is a TPM?

A Technical Program Manager is responsible for driving complex technical programs from inception to completion. Unlike Project Managers who might focus more on timelines and resources, TPMs need deep technical understanding to make informed decisions and effectively communicate between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Key Responsibilities

1. **Program Planning and Execution**: Create comprehensive program plans, identify dependencies, and manage risks.
2. **Cross-functional Coordination**: Align engineering, product, design, and other teams around common goals.
3. **Technical Understanding**: Develop sufficient technical depth to ask the right questions and make informed decisions.
4. **Communication**: Translate technical concepts for business stakeholders and vice versa.
5. **Problem Solving**: Identify and resolve blockers that impede program progress.

## First 30 Days: Focus on Learning

Your first month should be dedicated to:

- Understanding your product's architecture and technical stack
- Building relationships with key engineers and stakeholders
- Learning existing processes and tooling
- Mapping dependencies between teams and workstreams
- Identifying the critical path for your programs

Don't rush to make changes. Take time to understand why things work the way they do before proposing improvements.

## Building Your TPM Toolkit

Every effective TPM has a set of tools and frameworks they rely on:

- **RACI matrices** for clarifying decision-making authority
- **Risk registers** for tracking and mitigating potential issues
- **Dependency trackers** for visualizing cross-team requirements
- **Decision logs** for maintaining a record of key decisions and their rationale
- **Status reports** for keeping stakeholders informed of progress

In the next article, we'll dive deeper into cross-team coordination strategies and how to run effective program reviews.
